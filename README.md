# Understanding Capital Bikeshare Ridership

Created by Aren Carpenter

## Introduction

After some more advanced neural network projects focusing mainly on computer vision, I wanted to return to the data scientist's bread and butter, generating business insights from data through EDA and rigorous hypothesis testing. Utilizing the [Capital Bikeshare rider data](https://data.world/data-society/capital-bikeshare-2011-2012) from 2011-2012, I will illuminate the differences between registered and casual bikers and how various environmental and temporal features affect these populations.

With a climate crisis looming and alternative methods of personal transportation gaining popularity, short-term bike rentals through companies like CitiBike and Capital Bike offer users easy access to bikes. The main cohort of registered renters are business professionals on their morning and evening commutes, while a casual cohort utilizes the bikes for leisure mostly on weekends.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The data was collected and some small cleaning was required, mainly for time series analysis. Some types were recast, but, unlike most real-world data, this set was mostly intact. I wanted to focus on creating interesting and useful visualizations, but in the future will feature an incredibly messy data cleaning project.
